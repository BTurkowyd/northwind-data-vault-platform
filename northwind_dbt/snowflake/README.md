# Northwind Data Vault â€“ Snowflake dbt Project

This directory contains a [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) project implementing a Data Vault 2.0 model for the Northwind sample database, designed to run on Snowflake and integrate with external Iceberg tables.

## Project Structure

- **models/marts/**: Exposes business marts as Snowflake tables, each selecting from an external Iceberg table (e.g., `mart_sales`, `mart_customer_sales`, `mart_product_sales`, etc.).
- **macros/**: Custom dbt macros for automation, including:
  - `apply_column_tags_for_all_models.sql`: Applies column-level tags (e.g., PII, sensitivity) to all models.
  - `snowflake_generate_from_catalog.sql`: Generates and creates external Snowflake tables for all Iceberg marts defined in the dbt catalog.
- **analyses/**, **seeds/**, **snapshots/**, **tests/**: Standard dbt directories for additional data and testing.
- **.dbt/**: Contains your dbt profile and connection configuration.
- **dbt_project.yml**: Main project configuration.
- **packages.yml**: dbt package dependencies (e.g., `dbt_utils`).

## Snowflake & External Table Integration

- Uses the [dbt-snowflake](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/snowflake-profile) adapter.
- Marts are exposed as Snowflake tables that select from external Iceberg tables (created via macros).
- External tables are defined in the `external_tables` source in `schema.yml`.
- Column-level metadata (PII, sensitivity) is managed via macros and the model YAML.

## How to Use

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   dbt deps
   ```

2. **Configure your Snowflake profile**
   Edit `.dbt/profiles.yml` with your Snowflake account and authentication details.

3. **Run models**
   ```sh
   dbt run
   ```

4. **Test models**
   ```sh
   dbt test
   ```

5. **Generate and refresh external tables**
   Use the provided macros to generate and refresh external tables as needed.

6. **View documentation**
   ```sh
   dbt docs generate
   dbt docs serve
   ```
